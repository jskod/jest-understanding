# Snapshots

Snapshots are a fantastic tool for identifying unexpected interface changes within your application â€“ whether that interface is an API response, UI, logs, or error messages. As with any testing strategy, there are some best-practices you should be aware of, and guidelines you should follow, in order to use them effectively.

```js
// snapshot property matcher
it('will check the matchers and pass', () => {
  const user = {
    createdAt: new Date(),
    id: Math.floor(Math.random() * 20),
    name: 'LeBron James',
  };

  expect(user).toMatchSnapshot({
    createdAt: expect.any(Date),
    id: expect.any(Number),
  });
});

// Snapshot
exports[`will check the matchers and pass 1`] = `
Object {
  "createdAt": Any<Date>,
  "id": Any<Number>,
  "name": "LeBron James",
}
`;
```

## Snapshots for UI
Snapshot tests are a very useful tool whenever you want to make sure your UI does not change unexpectedly.

A typical snapshot test case for a mobile app renders a UI component, takes a screenshot, then compares it to a reference image stored alongside the test. The test will fail if the two images do not match: either the change is unexpected, or the screenshot needs to be updated to the new version of the UI component.

```js
import React from 'react';
import Link from '../Link.react';
import renderer from 'react-test-renderer';

it('renders correctly', () => {
  const tree = renderer
    .create(<Link page="http://www.facebook.com">Facebook</Link>)
    .toJSON();
  expect(tree).toMatchSnapshot();
});
```
The first time this test is run, Jest creates a snapshot file that looks like this:

```js
exports[`renders correctly 1`] = `
<a
  className="normal"
  href="http://www.facebook.com"
  onMouseEnter={[Function]}
  onMouseLeave={[Function]}
>
  Facebook
</a>
`;
```
The snapshot artifact should be committed alongside code changes, and reviewed as part of your code review process. Jest uses pretty-format to make snapshots human-readable during code review. On subsequent test runs Jest will simply compare the rendered output with the previous snapshot. If they match, the test will pass. If they don't match, either the test runner found a bug in your code (in this case, it's <Link> component) that should be fixed, or the implementation has changed and the snapshot needs to be updated.

## updating snapshots

If a UI component was updated intentionally, you'd want to update the snapshot to the latest version.

If you run the update UI test, it will try to match with previous snapshot and will eventually fail the test, to update the snapshot to the latest version you need to run `jest --updateSnapshot` command or `jest -u` short version.

Once `jest -u` is run, Jest will not compare snapshots with previous version, instead update the snapshot and pass the test.

### TL;DR;
> Be certain to run `jest -u` to update snapshots. Otherwise, it will update your snapshots even if they were buggy or error prone.

## React Component Testing
A similar approach can be taken when it comes to testing your React components. Instead of rendering the graphical UI, which would require building the entire app, you can use a test renderer to quickly generate a serializable value for your React tree.

```js
import React from 'react';
import Link from '../Link.react';
import renderer from 'react-test-renderer';

it('renders correctly', () => {
  const tree = renderer
    .create(<Link page="http://www.facebook.com">Facebook</Link>)
    .toJSON();
  expect(tree).toMatchSnapshot();
});
```
The first time this test is run, Jest creates a snapshot file that looks like this:

```js
exports[`renders correctly 1`] = `
<a
  className="normal"
  href="http://www.facebook.com"
  onMouseEnter={[Function]}
  onMouseLeave={[Function]}
>
  Facebook
</a>
`;
```
